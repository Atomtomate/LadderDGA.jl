n_pos_fermi_freqs = 100         #  Number of positive fermionic matsubara frequencies. The matsubara frequency will be sampled symmetrically around zero. So the space of fermionic matsubara frequencies will be sampled by 2NÎ½ elements in total. Will be used for the triangular vertex as well as the self energy
