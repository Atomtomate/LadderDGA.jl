There are two functionalities which have been factored out to separate projects: Handeling of frequency sums and operations involving k-grids.

## Frequency Summations

The summation over Matsubara frequencies is defined over a set on infinitely many frequencies.
A canonical approach to approximate this sum,


## K-Grids
